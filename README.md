# Demos

This repository contains a few end-to-end Timeflux demos.

Currently, you can find:
- a [P300-speller](../../tree/main/speller/P300/) implementing [ASAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07807) (Bayesian accumulation of Riemannian probabilities) and other methods ;
- a [CVEP-speller](../../tree/main/speller/CVEP/) ;
- a [hyperscanning](../../tree/main/hyperscanning/) acquisition application using Jinja and environment variables for customization ;
- a fully-configurable [oddball protocol](../../tree/main/oddball) with visual, auditory and haptic support ;
- a simple neurofeedback application based on [frequency bands](../../tree/main/neurofeedback/bands/) ;
- a 4-class "[Rock, Paper, Scissors & Rest](../../tree/main/roshambo/)" classification engine using EMG signals ;
- a [cardiac coherence](../../tree/main/coherence/) biofeedback application.

More demos will be added soon.
Have fun!
